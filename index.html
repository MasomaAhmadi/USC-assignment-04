					<ul>
						<li>
							If there was ever a car that could define an entire generation, it
							would have to be the Delorean DMC-12. Its peculiarly desirable
							silhouette – with a blend of both futuristic and retro looks –
							would go on to catapult it to cult status as one of the co-stars
							of the Back to the Future movie series.
						</li>
						<li>
							Through the scope of being an actual automobile, there is nothing
							particularly desirable or outstanding about it. Its 130 hp engine
							could only propel the car from 0-60 mph in just under 10 seconds,
							which makes you wonder how Marty McFly even got up to the 88 mph
							needed to traverse the flow of time.
						</li>
						<li>
							The good news is that DeLorean as a company still exists and
							offers restoration services for your DMC-12. You can also
							commission some upgrades which will bring it a notch closer to
							modern standards, including an engine tuning package which will
							allow the stock power plant to produce over 200 hp.
						</li>
